        <h4>Console Modifications</h4>
        <p>
          for most console you can upgrade everything from appearance to playability through many different mods. 
          You can change your consoles colors through shell swaps that offer a wide vairity of themes and shades.
          <br><br>
          Prices on Shells are constantly changing and can go up or down, but generally you can expect to pay
          around $50.00 - $80.00 depending on the console and how much you want to customize.
          <br><br>
          ***You must provide the console for the shell swap. The condition of the internals (motherboard and such) and their
          functionality will not be effected in the process. Any console that arrive in non-working conditions will be
          returned as such unless specified and repairs are requested.

        <h4>IPS Screens</h4>
        <p>
          IPS screens are a great way to bring new life and allbeit a better way to game on 
          your older handheld systems. For many who know, the original Screens featured on GameBoys, GameBoy Advance
          and Even some models of GameBoy Advance SP, it can be difficult to see the screen without proper lighting. 
          With an IPS screen you can game without having to worry about these things. With backlight screens you can game 
          anywhere and at anytime.
          <br><br>
          Most IPS screen will run between $30.00 - $50.00 and can come in different configurations.
          <br><br>
          ***Unless you opt in for an IPS ready shell for your system, there will need to be slight modifications
          done to the original shell in order for the new screen to fit.

        <h4>Custom Firmware and Homebrew</h4>
        <p>
          At Infinite Confusion, we support the preservation and continued enjoyment of classic gaming systems 
          through legitimate homebrew and open-source firmware projects.<br><br>
          We do not sell, distribute, or charge for custom firmware or game ROMs under any circumstances. 
          All firmware and software used in our work are freely available community projects intended to 
          extend the lifespan of older consoles and enable homebrew development.<br><br>
          If you own a console that’s no longer functioning properly or can no longer read discs/cartridges, 
          we can help you install or restore software that allows you to continue using your legally owned games 
          and enjoy new homebrew content.<br><br>
          Our assistance is offered freely as a community service — there are no fees for software installation 
          or consultation. If you choose to leave a voluntary donation to support game preservation efforts, 
          it’s always appreciated but never expected.<br><br>
          Our goal is simple: preserve gaming history and give classic systems a second life for future generations 
          to enjoy.
